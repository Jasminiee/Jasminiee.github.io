### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, Part 2

    I think this was a fun lab because I was able to learn how to calculate
    the number of days between the start date and the end date. I also liked
    that we are able to put in any type of number for both the start date and
    end date and see the number of days between those dates show up. It was
    also interesting to use the "PromptForInt" function for the first time.

* Lab 6, Part 1

    Although the coding for this lab was pretty short compared to other labs,
    I think it was still pretty fun figuring out the concept of command-line
    arguments. It wasn't a smooth process, since we did run into some errors
    along the way. I just like the entire purpose of this lab, where I can
    type any three ingredients to fill in the blanks for the sandwich order.

* Lab 4, Part 2

    This lab was fun to do because I was just figuring out the structure and
    the way to use the if statements correctly for the Hi-Lo game. It was a
    little challenging when I ran into some issues with the wrong output of
    the code. But it was still interesting to use if statements and else if
    statements together for the first time.
